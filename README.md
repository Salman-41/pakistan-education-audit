# Pakistan Education Policy Audit (2013-2016)

An interactive research publication presenting Pakistan's 2013-2016 education data through high-end cinematic frontend design. This project translates complex policy analysis into clear, visually-driven narratives using minimal, calm design with intentional motion.

## í¼Ÿ Vision
Build an **Awwwards-level interactive research website** that bridges the gap between raw data and public understanding. The site uses "Research-Grade Motion" to emphasize findings without distracting the reader.

## í»  Tech Stack
- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Animation**: [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) with ScrollTrigger for parallax and scroll-linked reveals
- **Smooth Scroll**: [Lenis](https://lenis.darkroom.engineering/) for momentum-based interaction
- **Visualizations**: [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for generative data art and interactive maps
- **Deployment**: Optimized for Vercel

## í³– Narrative Structure
The site unfolds in 5 distinct chapters:
1. **CONTEXT**: Framing the importance of Pakistan's education landscape.
2. **DISPARITIES**: Visualizing regional and gender-based divides.
3. **SYSTEMS VIEW**: Exploring causality between resources, security, and outcomes.
4. **HIDDEN PATTERNS**: Highlighting counter-intuitive findings and positive deviance.
5. **INTERPRETATION**: Policy implications and confidence-based synthesis.

## í³Š Data Source
Utilizes the [Kaggle Pakistan Education Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mesumraza/pakistan-education-performance-dataset), processed into static JSON specs for high-performance rendering.

## íº€ Getting Started

First, install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the interactive publication.

## í²Ž Design Principles
- **Editorial First**: Content-driven layout with generous white space.
- **Intentional Motion**: Every animation answers "What changed?" or "Where should I look?".
- **Calm Confidence**: A sophisticated light-theme palette (Slate & Emerald) designed for long-form reading.
